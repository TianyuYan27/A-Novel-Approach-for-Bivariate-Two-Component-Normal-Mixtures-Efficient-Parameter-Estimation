# A-Novel-Approach-for-Bivariate-Two-Component-Normal-Mixtures-Efficient-Parameter-Estimation
This repository provides the implementation of the method described in《Statistical Inference for Bivariate Two-Component Normal Mixtures: Characterization of Representative Points and Efficient Parameter Estimation》
# Simulation  
The file `Simulation.R` contains the numerical simulation procedures for Bivariate Two Component Normal Mixtures parameter estimation using the proposed approach. The file `EM.R` contains parameter estimation simulation procedures using the EM algorithm. We considered four types of Bivariate Two Component Normal Mixtures example scenarios for simulation, utilizing 32-core parallel processing for the experiments. The `Function.R` file contains all necessary functions required for the simulations. The aforementioned paper contains detailed descriptions of the methods.
# Usage
We provide The_Proposed_Method.R which can be directly used to implement the algorithm from the aforementioned paper and automatically loads the `Function.R` file containing all necessary simulation functions.
